# Multi-Tenant Snow Removal System Setup

Your snow removal system now supports **multiple companies** in a single database! Each company's data is completely isolated and secure.

## üè¢ **What's New: Multi-Tenancy**

### **Company Isolation**

- Each company has its own sites, employees, and reports
- Employees can only see data from their company
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures data separation
- Different subscription plans per company

### **Role-Based Access**

- **Owner**: Full company control + billing
- **Admin**: Employee management, settings
- **Manager**: View all company reports, manage sites
- **Employee**: Create reports for assigned sites

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Migration**

### **Step 1: Run New Schema**

Replace your existing schema with the multi-tenant version:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL editor
-- Copy contents from: database/migrations/snow-removal-schema-multi-tenant.sql
```

### **Step 2: Migrate Existing Data (if any)**

If you have existing single-tenant data:

```sql
-- Create a default company for existing data
INSERT INTO companies (name, slug, subscription_plan)
VALUES ('Your Company Name', 'your-company', 'basic');

-- Get the company ID
SELECT id FROM companies WHERE slug = 'your-company';

-- Update existing sites (replace 'COMPANY-UUID-HERE' with actual ID)
UPDATE sites SET company_id = 'COMPANY-UUID-HERE' WHERE company_id IS NULL;

-- Update existing employees
UPDATE employees SET company_id = 'COMPANY-UUID-HERE' WHERE company_id IS NULL;
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Setting Up Your First Company**

### **Option 1: Manual Setup**

  '555-SNOW',
  'info@acmesnow.com',
  'premium'
);

-- 2. Add sites for your company
INSERT INTO sites (company_id, name, address, priority, size_sqft, typical_salt_usage_kg)
SELECT
  c.id,
  'Main Office Complex',
  '123 Business Ave, City, ST 12345',
  'high',
  50000,
  100.0
FROM companies c WHERE c.slug = 'acme-snow-removal';

-- 3. Create employee profiles (after users sign up)
INSERT INTO employees (company_id, user_id, employee_number, role, site_assignments)
SELECT
  c.id,
  'USER-UUID-HERE',  -- Replace with actual user UUID
  'EMP001',
  'admin',
  ARRAY['SITE-UUID-HERE']  -- Replace with actual site UUIDs
